The spread of a pathogen can start out slowly, but as larger numbers of the susceptible population become infected, the number of infected experiences exponential growth. Eventually this growth levels off as the size of the susceptible population decreases and the populations of the infected and recovered increase.

This can be modeled with variations of logistic (sigmoid) functions.

Data from the reference regions (Italy, South Korea, and Hubei province China) are each fitted with a logistic function beginning on the day of the 100th confirmed case in that country.  

The models for the three countries are then scaled to the U.S. population and aligned along the time-axis to best fit the US data for total confirmed cases.  

Graphing these projections together demonstrates how the U.S. compares to benchmark regions, to help give more clarity in what the U.S. path going forward might look like.

#### US Model Stats - includes data up to an including 5/9/2020

It is not clear that the US has passed an inflection point, so expect the model to be highly variable.

#### Daily Percent Change in US Cases

On the positive side, the percent change in US cases has been steadily 
decreasing. When this value goes below zero, the number of new cases 
reported each day will start to decrease.
